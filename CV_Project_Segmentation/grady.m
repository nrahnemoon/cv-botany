%   Input:
%           I - Input RGB image
%        I_fg - Foreground/background segmentation mask (if not available, use [])
%       seeds - Seed locations
%      labels - Integer object labels for each seed
%        beta - Weighting parameter
%
%   Output:
%           M - Leaf segmentation mask
%           P - Probability estimates for each label
